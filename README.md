In this mini-article, my goal is to try to explain the git stages and the Git commands.
Perhaps, at least it might be easier to understand a specific command based where it is used.
 at the end of the day every developer must get good at git üíØ.

### History and Fcats
- In 2005, Linus Torvalds created Git to address the shortcomings of existing version control systems used for the development of the Linux kernel.
- Git was designed to be a distributed version control system, allowing developers to work on a project independently, even without network access or a central server.
- Git gained popularity within the open-source community due to its speed, scalability, and ability to handle large codebases.

### Good to remember :
- GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and additional collaboration features
 <h2 align="center"> Why Do we use git ?</h2> 

#### Collaboration: 

- Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. It enables them to make changes to the codebase independently and merge their changes seamlessly.

#### Tracking Changes:

- Git tracks changes made to the codebase over time. It creates a snapshot of the code at each commit, allowing developers to view the history of changes and understand how the code has evolved. This helps in identifying and fixing bugs, reverting to previous versions if needed, and maintaining a clear record of development progress.

#### Code Integrity:

- With Git, each developer has their own local copy of the codebase. This means that even if someone makes a mistake or accidentally deletes something, the code can usually be restored from another copy.

#### Open Source Collaboration:

- Git is widely used in open source projects. Learning Git enables you to contribute to open source projects, collaborate with other developers, and leverage third-party libraries and frameworks.
- 
#### Version Control Best Practices:

- Learning Git also introduces you to version control best practices, such as creating branches for new features or bug fixes, merging branches, resolving conflicts, and keeping a clean commit history

 <h3>Working directory</h3> 
 
```md
The actual file's states in the file system, they can be tracked or untracked, they can be changed or deleted.
```

 <h3>Staging area</h3> 
 
```md
The area where we prepared a set of files for a new version based its changes.
```

<h3>HEAD</h3> 

```md
It's the pointer in the current branch, it has the complete repository history.
```

### <h3>Remote Repo</h3> 

```md
In simple words its' just a space provided to share and collaborate your code with the community and frineds . 
```
